## **Phase 1: Understand the Basics (Week 1–2)**

### **1.1 Fundamentals of System Design**
- **What is system design?**
  - High-level vs low-level design
  - Why it's used in interviews

  - Latency vs Throughput
  - Vertical vs Horizontal scaling

### **1.2 Learn about System Design Components**
Start with understanding core concepts and terminologies:
- **Client-Server Model**
- **Load Balancing**
- **Caching**
- **Databases: SQL vs NoSQL**
- **Data Partitioning (Sharding)**
- **Replication**
- **CAP Theorem**
- **Consistency Patterns (Strong, Eventual, etc.)**

- Federation

### **3.5 Consistency & Availability**
- Eventual Consistency
- Quorum-Based Replication
- Consensus Algorithms: Paxos, Raft

---

## **Phase 4: Practice with Real-World System Design Problems (Week 8–10)**

Start breaking down popular systems:
### **4.1 Social Media**
- Design Twitter, Instagram, Facebook
- Components: User Service, Feed Generator, Media Storage, Notification Service

### **4.2 Messaging Apps**
- WhatsApp, Slack
- Features: Real-time communication, delivery confirmation, group chats

### **4.3 E-commerce Systems**
- Amazon
- Components: Product Catalog, Cart Service, Order Service, Search, Payments

### **4.4 Streaming Platform**
- YouTube, Netflix
- Video Upload, Transcoding, CDN, Recommendation Engine

### **4.5 Ride Sharing App**
- Uber
- Real-time matching, geo-location, surge pricing

### **How to Practice**:
For each system:
- Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- Identify Key Components
- Draw High-Level Architecture
- Think Through: Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Consistency, Bottlenecks

---

## **Phase 5: Communication & Whiteboarding Practice (Week 11–12)**

### **5.1 Practice Mock Interviews**
- With peers or platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io
- Focus on explaining trade-offs
- Practice drawing on whiteboards or virtual tools (Excalidraw, Lucidchart)

### **5.2 Structured Answering Approach**
Use the **FAANG framework** (popular in top-tier interviews):
1. **Clarify requirements**
2. **Define APIs**
3. **High-Level Architecture**
4. **Component Deep Dive**
5. **Scaling & Bottlenecks**
6. **Trade-offs & Improvements**

---

## **Phase 6: Mastering Advanced Concepts (Optional but Recommended)**

### **6.1 Distributed Systems Internals**
- Consensus (Paxos, Raft)
- Distributed Transactions
- Leader Election

### **6.2 Infrastructure as Code / DevOps**
- Kubernetes, Docker
- CI/CD, Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Logging & Tracing (ELK Stack, OpenTelemetry)

### **6.3 Real-World Failures**
- Read failure post-mortems (e.g., Amazon, Netflix outages)
- Understand what went wrong and how design could prevent it

---

## **Tools You Should Know**
- **Drawing Tools**: Excalidraw, Whimsical, Lucidchart
- **Hands-on Tools**:
  - Redis, Postgres/MongoDB (Docker setup)
  - Kafka (basic CLI testing)
  - REST API development (Postman, Swagger)

---

## **Daily Plan Example (for 12-week plan)**

- **Day 1–2**: Concepts (Read + Note-taking)
- **Day 3–4**: Mini Project or Use Case Design
- **Day 5**: Hands-on (Docker/Redis/API testing)
- **Day 6**: Mock Interview or Whiteboard Practice
- **Day 7**: Rest & Review

---

## **Interview Prep Tips**
- Always ask clarifying questions
- Keep architecture diagrams simple but insightful
- Focus on bottlenecks, latency, availability
- Communicate your thoughts clearly and constantly
- Learn to say "it depends" and justify your choices
